# The Charmed House
Basically this is a old style convensational text Game for Linux OS. The player can type simple words into a command line interface (CLI): <command> <parameter1> ... <parameterN>
Usually, the comands will have one parameter or two parameters at most. Rarelly a command will have 3 or more parameters, but it is opened to build a more complex conversational game. 
The image shown in game are pure text converting from originals picture formats. I will try to represent the current player situation ilustrating in any sence the progression of a player in game with at least old style console primitive graphics.
