# Introduction

Old style convensational game based on text under Linux OS. The player interacts with the wordd typing simple phrases verbs and names. It is a simple command line interface (CLI): command parameter1 ... parameterN. Usually, these comands will have one parameter or two parameters at most. Rarelly a command will have 3 or more parameters, but it is opened to build a more complex conversational game. 

The world is divided in scenes, so the player will use cardinal directions to move around. Many objects are available to be used with others objets. An inventario allows to the player to bring objects between scenes. Somethimes it would be a little tricky to solve.

The scenes have text images that are shown in all game as pure text converting from pictures. the game tries to represent the current player situation ilustrating in any sence the progression of a player in game with at least old style console primitive graphics.
